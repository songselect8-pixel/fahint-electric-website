# Design System: FAHINT

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Open Workshop"**

FAHINT uses a clear navy-and-blue frame, Source Sans 3, generous margins and familiar pill actions. Real product and company evidence gives the visual system its character.

The company editorial treatment recorded here applies to Home's #studio-making chapter, /capabilities and /about. Their larger headings and broad editorial layouts are scoped treatments; product pages, forms, Blog and Contact retain their own implemented patterns. Home and About retain documentary photographs. Capabilities uses visibly disclosed, AI-refined editorial images based on supplied factory photographs, as requested by the user on 2026-10-08.

**Key Characteristics:**

- A shared navy, blue, white and pale-paper palette.
- Documentary photographs with useful captions and restrained surrounding copy.
- Visible keyboard focus, directly accessible factory stories and complete mobile images.

**The Scope Rule.** Use the shared frame across routes; apply company editorial display, photograph and callout treatments only to their named chapters.

Source of truth: [shared frame](src/styles/site-system.css), [base font and legacy tokens](src/styles.css), [company pages](src/styles/company-pages.css), [Capabilities layout](src/styles/capabilities.css), [Home Studio](src/styles/studio.css) and [shared company components](src/components/company/CompanyShared.jsx). The frontmatter records current shared tokens and explicitly named company roles; it does not replace older contextual tokens.

## Colors

Sidecar tonal ramps are generated preview swatches, not additional production palette tokens.

**Primary.** Deep navy anchors the frame and dark chapters. Blue identifies primary actions and process numbers.

**Neutral.** Ink carries headings; muted blue-gray carries body copy and captions. White and pale paper alternate chapters, with quiet blue-gray rules separating related material. Dark chapters use the existing lighter copy and link colors from the owning stylesheet.

## Typography

Source Sans 3 is bundled as a variable font, with the system fallbacks in the body token. Shared page and section titles are defaults; the company display and headline roles are local to About. Capabilities uses its scoped page title (44–72px desktop, 38–58px mobile) and section title (36–54px desktop, 32–42px mobile). Headings in these surfaces use sentence case and balanced wrapping. Company body text is slightly larger than the base body (17px), generally limited to 70ch.

Company display type adapts at 1050px to clamp(44px, 5.6vw, 60px), then at 760px to clamp(40px, 9.8vw, 64px). Company section titles become clamp(34px, 8vw, 42px) on mobile. Home's testing headline has its own scale, clamp(40px, 4vw, 68px), with a mobile size of 42px.

## Layout

The shared content frame caps at 1600px using the gutter token. Company sections use the shared section spacing, changing to 64px at 760px. Home's testing chapter retains its local spacing, clamp(72px, 7vw, 120px).

About opens with a roughly 60/40 title-and-summary grid and a broad workshop photograph, capped at 1920px with 24px outer margins. The desktop hero uses a 2.35:1 workshop crop. At 760px the title grid stacks and the hero photograph returns to its complete natural aspect ratio, edge to edge; captions keep the page gutter.

Capabilities caps content at 1440px, retaining the shared gutter. Its navy hero groups the title, summary and action beside a 16:9 workshop overview. The manufacturing chapter presents three equally sized 3:2 images with adjacent descriptions: component assembly, GFCI functional testing and laboratory verification. All four generated compositions remain uncropped at every breakpoint. The pale-paper OEM chapter pairs grouped options with the unchanged product packaging photograph, followed by a vertical four-step process and a combined navy inquiry/documentation ending. At 760px the major grids and three image-led stories stack in DOM order and section padding becomes 56px. Every rule is scoped to `.capabilities-page`.

The About team gallery uses unequal columns and natural image ratios, then stacks on mobile. Home testing pairs a dominant intact GFCI photo with navy copy; mobile moves the copy above the photograph and stacks the USB support area.

## Elevation & Depth

The company editorial chapters are flat: navy and pale-paper fields, whitespace and thin rules provide separation. Photographs and the documentation callout have no shadow. The shared solid header retains its shallow shadow; the existing site still has contextual card and form shadows outside these chapters.

## Shapes

Pill actions remain the familiar brand control. The shared rounded media/card token remains available for incumbent modules, including certificate cards. Capabilities photographs and the packaging frame use the shared 14px radius on all four corners. Home/About editorial photographs and the scoped documentation callout retain straight corners. “Square” describes the corners, not a forced 1:1 photograph.

## Components

**Company actions.** Primary blue and inverse white links use the button tokens, a minimum height of 52px and an inline arrow. Hover changes the fill. Text links have a minimum height of 44px and underline on hover. Company controls share a visible focus outline (3px, 5px offset).

**Chapter navigation.** About section links wrap across lines and target real section anchors. Capabilities has three equal-width links on navy, with full route-and-hash destinations. About uses a bottom rule; Capabilities uses a top rule. Anchored company sections retain a header offset (110px).

**Factory stories.** Three named articles show component assembly, GFCI functional testing and laboratory verification simultaneously. There are no tabs, hidden panels or automatic transitions. The functional-testing article explicitly distinguishes inspection from assembly and links to Home's original testing photographs. The laboratory copy describes bench instruments, not the environmental chamber that used to appear here.

**Documentation.** Capabilities places the model-scope explanation and certificate link alongside the closing inquiry, separated by a thin vertical rule on desktop and a horizontal rule on mobile. The shared pale company callout remains available to other incumbent modules.

**Documentary photography.** Keep captions adjacent to the actual image and explicit intrinsic dimensions. The selected factory photographs and their sources are recorded in [the manifest](public/assets/images/company/factory/manifest.json) and adjacent .webp.json files. The broad About workshop uses electronics-workshop-v2.webp (1920 × 1440). Home's existing scroll reveal moves the complete photograph; unsupported and reduced-motion environments receive the complete static image. Reduced-motion styles also disable company transitions and animations.

**The Evidence Rule.** Photographs show specific work. Their captions and neighboring copy must describe the pictured activity and preserve model-specific qualification.

**Capabilities editorial-image exception.** The four AI-refined promotional images are separate from original evidence assets. Their generation prompts and source/output hashes are recorded in [the generation record](docs/assets/capabilities-photography-2026-10-08.json), with webpage dimensions and file hashes in [their manifest](public/assets/images/company/capabilities/manifest.json). The hero caption and factory-section note disclose AI refinement. These visuals are not technical records; do not use generated screen readings, labels or fine equipment details to establish specifications, test results or certification. The original photographs, Home/About/product evidence and actual packaging remain unchanged.

**GFCI factory context.** The seven GFCI detail pages share three dedicated workshop photographs from `companyPhotos`: assembly benches, GFCI functional-testing stations and the laboratory. All three originals are 4032 × 2268; their webpage exports are 1600 × 900. The existing three-column gallery displays them at their natural 16:9 ratio, with no cropping or letterboxing, and stacks on phones. Captions distinguish these activities; the accompanying note makes test requirements model-specific. This does not add the module to other product families or replace Home/About/Capabilities imagery.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do preserve the FAHINT identity, source photographs, manifest and adjacent asset provenance files.
- Do show complete mobile photographs and preserve the natural aspect ratios of equipment images.
- Do retain visible focus, semantic article and navigation labels, and reduced-motion alternatives for incumbent animation.
- Don't spread company editorial heading sizes or square photo corners to products, forms, Blog or Contact.
- Don't label GFCI functional testing as assembly, replace original factory evidence with generated content, or substitute lower-resolution catalog crops for the supplied originals. Only the explicitly disclosed Capabilities editorial visuals use the AI-refinement exception above.
- Don't turn photographs or certificates into unsupported production, performance, partnership, delivery or range-wide certification claims.
