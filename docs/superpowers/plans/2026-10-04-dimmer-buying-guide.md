# Dimmer Buying Guide Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use executing-plans inline. The approved scope calls for the main agent only, not subagents. Steps use checkbox syntax.

**Goal:** Publish one researched English dimmer buying guide locally, connecting two verified FAHINT models to the existing buying and inquiry flow.

**Architecture:** Reuse the existing posts registry and BlogPost table/list/link renderer. Add data, discovery links and focused regression coverage only; do not change article components, CSS, product specifications, domain settings or inquiry behavior.

**Tech Stack:** Existing React 18, React Router 6, Vite 5, Vitest and Testing Library. No dependency additions.

**Approved design:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-dimmer-buying-guide-design.md`, approved by “开始吧” on 2026-10-04.

**Workspace:** Reuse `codex/prelaunch-buyer-tools` in the current checkout. This is a normal checkout, not a linked worktree; no new worktree or subagents. Preserve unrelated untracked files.

---

## File map

Create:
- `src/data/dimmerBuyingGuide.js`: original guide content, source references and linked model table.
- `src/pages/DimmerBuyingGuide.test.jsx`: accessible content, model data boundaries and discovery links.

Modify:
- `src/data/posts.js`: register the new post first.
- `src/data/buyingGuides.js`: dimmer-family guide link only.
- `src/pages/Resources.jsx`: add a second guide entry while retaining USB and downloads.
- `public/sitemap.xml`: add one route, retaining the existing domain.
- `src/pages/Blog.test.jsx`, `src/pages/UsbBuyingGuide.test.jsx`: exact new article/illustration counts.
- `src/prerender.test.jsx`: one static/subpath regression test.

Do not change `BlogPost.jsx`, styles, product records, dependencies, inquiry storage or deployment configuration.

## Task 1: Verify baseline and introduce failing coverage

- [x] Confirm current branch and untracked files; dependencies are already installed.
- [x] Run `npm test -- src/pages/Blog.test.jsx src/pages/UsbBuyingGuide.test.jsx src/pages/Resources.test.jsx src/prerender.test.jsx`. Baseline: 53 tests passed in four files.
- [ ] Create `src/pages/DimmerBuyingGuide.test.jsx` with:

    expect(html).toContain('href="/fahint-electric-website/resources?family=dimmers"');
    expect(html).not.toContain('Loading page…');
  });
```

- [ ] Run `npm test -- src/pages/DimmerBuyingGuide.test.jsx src/prerender.test.jsx`. Expect six new failures caused by the missing article/model table/discovery links, with all existing SSR tests passing. Do not accept syntax/import errors as the red phase.

## Task 2: Add the guide through existing rendering

};
```

- [ ] In `src/data/posts.js`, import and register:

```js
import { usbBuyingGuide } from './usbBuyingGuide.js';
import { dimmerBuyingGuide } from './dimmerBuyingGuide.js';

export const posts = [
  dimmerBuyingGuide,
  usbBuyingGuide,
```

Keep every other post unchanged.

- [ ] In `src/pages/Blog.test.jsx`, set `expect(posts).toHaveLength(8)`; set the distinct-cover `size` expectation to `8`; extend illustration detection to `/application|product-gfci|product-usb|home-installations/` and expect `6` illustrations.
- [ ] In the existing USB guide Blog test, change only `'7 articles'` to `'8 articles'`.
- [ ] Review the article against the approved source matrix. Keep model-specific and industry statements separate. Verify both load ranges, VA units, unsupported phase type, missing driver-count data and sample-test boundaries.
- [ ] Apply copy-editing passes for structure, clarity, evidence, line editing and headline/SEO. Keep the restrained B2B voice; do not add urgency, testimonials, guarantees, legal claims or customer-project claims.

## Task 3: Connect the three entry points

- [ ] Replace only `buyingGuides.dimmers.resource` with:

```js
resource: { label: 'Read the dimmer buying guide', to: '/blog/dimmer-buying-guide-led-0-10v' },
```

- [ ] In Resources, immediately after the existing USB guide paragraph add:

```jsx
        <p className="resources-scope-note">
          Choosing lighting controls?{' '}
          <Link className="company-text-link" to="/blog/dimmer-buying-guide-led-0-10v">Read the dimmer buying guide <ArrowUpRight size={16} aria-hidden="true" /></Link>
        </p>
```

Preserve the USB guide, all document downloads and filter behavior.

- [ ] Before `</urlset>` in the public sitemap add:

```xml
  <url><loc>https://www.fahint.com/blog/dimmer-buying-guide-led-0-10v</loc></url>
```

- [ ] Run `npm test -- src/pages/DimmerBuyingGuide.test.jsx src/pages/Blog.test.jsx src/pages/UsbBuyingGuide.test.jsx src/pages/Resources.test.jsx src/prerender.test.jsx src/deployment.test.js`. All tests must pass.
- [ ] Inspect the scoped diff; no extra rendering/style/parameter changes.

## Task 4: Verify the local production output

- [ ] Run `npm test` and `npm run build`. Require a passing complete suite and successful public-page generation.
- [ ] Inspect the generated article HTML: one H1; seven content headings; a two-model/four-column table; seven quotation checklist items; proper title, description and Article metadata; complete text before hydration.
- [ ] Confirm asset exists and cover caption visibly says illustration. Existing model documents are linked rather than copied.
- [ ] Reuse the running preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4176/blog/dimmer-buying-guide-led-0-10v` if available. Do not terminate another preview.
- [ ] Use the Playwright skill and cached CLI for desktop 1440 × 1000 and mobile 390 × 844. Inspect opening and table screenshots; verify no page-level overflow and keyboard-focusable local table scrolling.
- [ ] Click Blog, dimmer-family and Resources entries to the guide. Click both model links and the dimmer document link. Do not submit inquiries or change saved selections.
- [ ] Check browser console errors. Preserve running preview; close only the browser session created for this check.
- [ ] Record verification results here. Run staged diff checks and commit only listed source/test/docs files.
- [ ] Request the Codex preview tab and provide the direct URL. Keep the branch and local commit; no push, merge, deployment, domain or email changes.

## Plan self-review

The seven approved sections, four external references, two model links and three discovery entries are fully defined. Existing renderer supports all required block shapes and metadata uses the registered post. Table assertions check actual catalog fields, not invented expected units. Screenshot provenance is explicit. No scope expansion or unresolved implementation choices.
