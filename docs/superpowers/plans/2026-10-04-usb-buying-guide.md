# USB Buying Guide Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking. The approved scope requires the main agent; do not delegate.

**Goal:** Publish one researched English USB buying guide locally, with seven verified model examples and existing buying-tool entry points.

**Architecture:** Keep the existing posts/BlogPost flow and add only native table/list rendering plus paragraph links. The new long-form post lives in one focused data file imported by posts; catalog data remains unchanged. Reuse BuyingGuide, Resources, metadata and prerendering without adding dependencies or services.

**Tech Stack:** React 18, React Router 6, Vite 5, Vitest/Testing Library, plain CSS.

---

Approved design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-usb-buying-guide-design.md`.
Continue in the existing `codex/prelaunch-buyer-tools` checkout as agreed for this batch. Preserve unrelated untracked files. No push, merge, deployment, domain or delivery-service changes.

## File map

- Create `src/data/usbBuyingGuide.js`: one sourced post, not a second catalog or content framework.
- Modify `src/data/posts.js`: import and list the new guide first.
- Modify `src/pages/BlogPost.jsx`: render native lists, tables and descriptive paragraph links.
- Modify `src/styles/company-pages.css`: article-only list/table styles and overflow containment.
- Modify `src/data/buyingGuides.js`, `src/pages/Resources.jsx`: visible article entry links.
- Modify `public/sitemap.xml`: one new route using the existing host.
- Modify `src/pages/Blog.test.jsx`, `src/prerender.test.jsx`; create `src/pages/UsbBuyingGuide.test.jsx`: targeted content, linking and server-body checks.
- The article's accepted full outline, seven-model values, source URLs and ten title candidates are in the approved design; no more market research or title-selection gate is needed.

## Task 1: Lock the new behavior with failing tests

- [x] Check the current branch and clean tracked baseline. Existing Blog/Resources/deployment tests: 66 passed.
- [ ] Create `src/pages/UsbBuyingGuide.test.jsx`:

```jsx
import { render, screen, within } from '@testing-library/react';
import { MemoryRouter, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import Blog from './Blog.jsx';

import Resources from './Resources.jsx';
import { BuyingGuide } from '../components/products/BuyingGuide.jsx';
import { findPost } from '../data/posts.js';
import { findCatalogProduct } from '../data/catalogProducts.js';

const slug = 'usb-wall-outlet-buying-guide';
const path = '/blog/' + slug;

      <Routes><Route path="/blog/:slug" element={<BlogPost />} /></Routes>
    </MemoryRouter>);
    expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 })).toHaveTextContent('USB Wall Outlet Buying Guide: Ports, PD and Power');
    const table = screen.getByRole('table', { name: 'FAHINT USB outlet shortlist' });

    expect(screen.getByRole('list', { name: 'USB outlet quotation checklist' })).toBeVisible();
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Browse USB outlet models' })).toHaveAttribute('href', '/products/usb-outlets');
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Compare A + C configurations' })).toHaveAttribute('href', '/products/usb-outlets?ports=a-c');

    expect(document.title).toBe(findPost(slug).title + ' | FAHINT');
  });

  it('keeps every shortlist model and charging figure tied to the published catalog', () => {
    const post = findPost(slug);
    expect(post).toBeDefined();
    const table = post.body.find(block => block.type === 'table');
    expect(table.rows).toHaveLength(7);
    for (const [model, ports, rating, charging] of table.rows) {
      const product = findCatalogProduct('usb-outlets', model.href.split('/').pop());
      expect(product?.sku).toBe(model.label);
      const summary = Object.fromEntries(product.specificationSummary);

    expect(post.coverCaption).toMatch(/illustrat/i);
    expect(new Set(post.sources.filter(source => source.href.startsWith('https:')).map(source => new URL(source.href).hostname)).size).toBe(4);
  });

  it('appears in the existing blog', () => {
    render(wrap(<Blog />));
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'USB Wall Outlet Buying Guide: Ports, PD and Power' })).toHaveAttribute('href', path);
    expect(screen.getByRole('status')).toHaveTextContent('7 articles');
  });

  });

  it('is linked from resources without replacing any document downloads', () => {
    render(wrap(<Resources />));
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Read the USB outlet buying guide' })).toHaveAttribute('href', path);
    expect(screen.getAllByRole('link', { name: /^Download .* PDF$/ })).toHaveLength(7);
  });
});
```

- [ ] Run `npm test -- src/pages/UsbBuyingGuide.test.jsx`. Expect failures for missing guide, table and entry links, not import or syntax errors.
- [ ] In `src/prerender.test.jsx`, add this case inside the published-page describe:

```jsx
it('prerenders the USB guide and preserves base-safe model and filter links', async () => {
  const html = await renderPage('/blog/usb-wall-outlet-buying-guide', '/fahint-electric-website/');
  expect(html).toContain('FAHINT USB outlet shortlist');
  expect(html).toContain('<table>');
  expect(html).toContain('FTR15QC-DC65W');
  expect(html).toContain('href="/fahint-electric-website/products/usb-outlets?ports=a-c"');
  expect(html).toContain('href="/fahint-electric-website/products/usb-outlets/f4p"');
  expect(html).toContain('USB outlet quotation checklist');
  expect(html).not.toContain('Loading page…');
});
```

- [ ] Run that targeted prerender case with `npm test -- src/prerender.test.jsx -t "prerenders the USB guide"`; expect the missing-content assertion to fail.

## Task 2: Write the guide and add the minimum article rendering

- [ ] Create the guide data with the following contract. Populate the approved seven sections as original English prose, using the primary research already reviewed. Include the exact seven approved models, quote checklist, four external references and own USB resource reference. The strings below define the real public title, route and required links:

- [ ] Update old Blog tests: count 7 posts/covers; compare the GFCI article's title by slug, not array index; include `product-usb` in illustration detection (5 illustrations).
- [ ] Run the article and existing Blog tests. The content tests should pass; the two unimplemented entry-link tests remain red until Task 3.
- [ ] Review the finished English text for structure, clarity, evidence, line editing and headline/SEO; use the copy-editing checklist without adding unsupported urgency, guarantees or certifications.

## Task 3: Make the guide discoverable

- [ ] Replace the USB-only buying-guide resource:
```js
resource: { label: 'Read the USB outlet buying guide', to: '/blog/usb-wall-outlet-buying-guide' },
```
- [ ] After the catalog block in Resources, add this paragraph using existing link styling; do not alter the document list:
```jsx
<p className="resources-scope-note">
  Choosing USB charging outlets?{' '}
  <Link className="company-text-link" to="/blog/usb-wall-outlet-buying-guide">Read the USB outlet buying guide <ArrowUpRight size={16} aria-hidden="true" /></Link>
</p>
```
- [ ] Add before `</urlset>`:
```xml
  <url><loc>https://www.fahint.com/blog/usb-wall-outlet-buying-guide</loc></url>
```
- [ ] Run `npm test -- src/pages/UsbBuyingGuide.test.jsx src/pages/Blog.test.jsx src/pages/Resources.test.jsx src/prerender.test.jsx src/deployment.test.js`; expect all green.
- [ ] Commit only planned files after inspection; retain all unrelated files.

## Task 4: Verify locally and hand off

- [ ] Run the complete existing `npm test` suite and `npm run build`.
- [ ] Inspect new root HTML: complete article, one H1, table/list, Article metadata, original source links, no loading placeholder.
- [ ] Use the existing preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4176/blog/usb-wall-outlet-buying-guide`; start it only if absent.
- [ ] Browser check at desktop and 390px mobile: readable table, keyboard-focusable local scrolling, no body overflow, correct article entry points, A+C filter link restores filters. Preserve existing compare/inquiry state; do not submit anything.
- [ ] Existing prerender test verifies the GitHub Pages subpath; do not change domain configuration or re-run slow-network benchmarks for this content-only change.
- [ ] Run `git diff --check`, inspect scoped diff, record tests and preview URL in this plan, commit finished local changes. No remote mutation.
- [ ] Open the article preview for the user and give a concise result and local-only status.

## Self-review

All seven content sections, seven model references, four external references, three entry points, native table/list accessibility, metadata/prerender and sitemap checks are mapped above. Local editing is authorized by the approved design. No new product claims, tool state changes, dependencies or deployment are included.
